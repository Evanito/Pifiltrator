##About:
  Pifiltrator is a python script designed to run unattended in remote locations without internet. It gains access to nearby networks using Wifite, and then connects to them. After connecting, it can be configured to send an email (or text message using email format) to alert you to pick it up. It can also be configured to run custom code after connecting using a shell file.
  
  Pifiltrator is in early stages of development.
